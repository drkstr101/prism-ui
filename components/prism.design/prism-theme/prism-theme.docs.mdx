A theme component for using the PrismTheme Design Language and tokens.

## Get started

To use the theme in your app, install the theme and apply it on your component tree.
Themes are usually applied on the root of your component tree.

```tsx
export function MyApp() {
  return (
    <PrismTheme>
      <Homepage />
    </PrismTheme>
  );
}
```


## Change the color scheme

Change the color scheme of the theme in the theme provider file:

```ts
export const PrismThemeProvider = createTheme<PrismThemeSchema>({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      // choose your own color here to generate a color scheme!
      origin: '#048A1B',
    }
  },
  tokens: prismThemeTokens,
});
```


## Add new tokens

You can add new tokens to the theme, to add new tokens use your theme tokens file:

```ts
export const prismThemeTokens = () => {
  return {
    /**
     * primary brand color. used for primary call to actions.
     * such as buttons, links, etc.
     */
    primaryColor: 'black',

    /**
     * color to use for borders.
     */
    borderColor: '#ededed',

    /**
     * color for secondary surfaces on the screen such
     * as cards or content outlines.
     */
    surfaceColor: '#ffffff',
  };
};
```

## Compose the theme

You can compose your theme to create specific variations such as Dark or Light themes, overriding some or all of its properties. 
To compose your theme, create a new component and use the theme as following:

```tsx
const myTokenOverrides: WallyThemeSchema = {
  backgroundColor: 'black'
};

export function MyApp() {
  return (
    <PrismTheme overrides={myTokenOverrides}>
      <Homepage />
    </PrismTheme>
  );
}
```
